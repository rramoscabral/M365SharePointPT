**Atenção:** Os exercícios não estão escritos em português por norma todo o conteúdo criado pelo formador [Ricardo Cabral](https://www.rramoscabral.com/) é escrito em inglês utilizando a terminologia original.


## Microsoft 365 user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience UI (User Interface) changes that occur after the development of this training content. As a result, the lab instructions and lab steps might not align correctly.

Cloud updates occur frequently, so you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**


## Lab Scenario 

In the ‘Raposa do Rio’ organization, all forms and surveys are made on paper. With digital transformation it is necessary to move all forms to a digital format.


## Objectives

The organization has a Microsoft 365 subscription with Microsoft Forms and wanted to use this product to replace paper forms and surveys.
